  <h1>Focus, ambition, or whatever</h1><p class="post-date"><post-date class="post-date">Wednesday August 7, 2024</post-date></p><p>It’s been about a month since I quit my programming job to be a full-time unemployed bum.</p><p>I wanted to have some time to myself where I could step off the corporate hamster wheel—a wheel that I’ve found increasingly little value in—and just do things that I wanted to do. I wanted to have more time to work on research and more time to have fun with my friends. Working full time just wasn’t conducive to doing both those things.</p><p>So far, I’ve definitely been a lot happier! It’s extremely freeing to have time to yourself, without forced obligations. Who would have thought?</p><p>But it also turns out that having copious amounts of free time to pursue personal interests comes with its own set of difficulties.</p><h2>Focus and Freedom</h2><p>It’s been fairly difficult for me to find my bearings without forced structure, particularly when I have so many things I want to spend time on and so much time that I could potentially spend on <em>whatever I want</em>. I don’t really want to waste these precious months of absolute freedom. But what does <em>waste</em> really mean to me? I don’t really know.</p><p>I do have some high-level goals of A) digging more deeply into programming languages research in preparation for graduate school, B) doing fun programming things that I didn’t have time for previously (perhaps related to programming languages/distributed systems research), and C) spending more time with people that I care about.</p><p>But it’s been shockingly easy to fall into doing lots of broad, unfocused work that I don’t feel like I’m getting much out of. Or simply messing around and not doing any work at all. And it’s also been fairly easy to put off seeing my friends and doing fun things outside of computers/programming because I either feel like I haven’t done enough work for the day or I feel like I could be doing more.</p><p>If I end up doing a PhD, self-directed work and lots of unstructured time are (probably) going to be the status quo. This is, in many ways, what I want! But I also need to figure out ways to direct myself so that I can make real progress on things that matter to me, while still making time for the things outside of “work” that make me happy and whole.</p><p>Having perpetual and immediate access to the internet doesn’t help. It’s very easy for me to go down these long rabbit holes into things that are tangentially relevant to my interests (or into things that are either just as engrossing or simply anxiety-inducing, i.e. YouTube baseball videos or LinkedIn). The internet is great, but only to an extent.</p><p>Something I need to work on is just putting on a pair of blinders and doing the things that are most important to me right now. You can’t do everything and you can’t know everything. That’s okay. Do the things you can do and enjoy it. That’s the whole damn point.</p><p>I think that allotting a set amount of time a week to look at the bigger picture, think broadly about things, and explore tangential interests could be valuable. There’s a tendency for those things to spiral indefinitely for me, and I think blocking out limited time for them could keep me in check and keep me moving forward on the hard, immediate things that require my attention (particularly when there’s no external pressure to keep me moving forward on those hard, immediate things).</p><h2>You and Your Research</h2><p>There’s a talk by Richard Hamming (of Hamming codes fame, among other things) titled <a href="https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“You and Your Research.”</a> It’s about research, I guess, and how to be successful doing it. And it’s often recommended reading/watching for people starting out in the research world.</p><p>There are some things in it that I think are really valuable. I’ve listed some of them here, in rough order of how meaningful they are to me right now:</p><ul><li><mark>working with the door open</mark> and keeping an eye on the “real world” outside of your research niche</li><li><mark>be OK with working on small problems</mark>—“plant the little acorns from which the mighty oak trees grow”</li><li>confidence, belief, courage as prerequisites for getting any work done</li><li>work in areas that you believe are important in your field, in a broad sense—this also ties into the importance of emotional and intellectual commitment to a problem</li><li>be OK with ambiguity and be open to criticism—<mark>emotional commitment is worth a lot less if it blinds you</mark></li><li>if you want to be remembered and have impact, you have to <em>sell</em> your work—you have to frame and communicate your work in a compelling way (Hamming believes you should spend at least as much time in polish/presentation as you did in the original research)</li><li>limitations and difficulties in your research can often be sources of research themselves and can often be quite fruitful—there are often ways to turn difficulties and weaknesses into strengths!</li><li>“Knowledge and productivity are like compound interest”—in other words, putting in the time is simply invaluable</li></ul><p>Some of this stuff is a bit trite, although it has more weight because it comes from the mouth of <em>the</em> Richard Hamming. A lot of it just boils down to: <mark>be humble, work hard, believe deeply in your work, and believe deeply in yourself.</mark> And it kind of assumes what I think is often the hardest part: an authentic desire to do research on a problem you care a lot about.</p><p>But the talk also got me thinking a bit about ego and ambition and how they relate to my own life.</p><hr/><p>I think having some kind of ego and ambition is a prerequisite to do any sort of novel, cool, and exciting work. You have to want to do something ambitious and have the ego (or self-delusion) to believe that A) what you’re doing matters and B) that you can make real progress on it. But, of course, ego and ambition can easily turn sour. A big part of having ambition and still being a healthy, happy person is finding a way to balance those things. Hamming’s talk offers some guidance, but it’s just a really difficult and immensely personal balance to strike.</p><p>I think for me, at the moment, it’s just important to remember that I can’t do everything that interests me. I simply don’t have the time or the ability. If I want to make progress and do something that meaningful pushes things forward, I need to accept my limitations and focus on a few things that are most important and most interesting to me right now.</p><p>I also think it’s important for me to try and <a href="https://www.recurse.com/self-directives" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">learn generously</a>. In a highly competitive space like academic research (or startups, or even just the software job market right now), it’s often tempting to withold knowledge or get somewhere and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNeBit7CSps&amp;list=LL&amp;index=2&amp;pp=gAQBiAQB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pull up the ladder behind yourself</a>. I think this is extremely damaging, particularly in research, and I think it’s important to actively push against it. Research isn’t a zero-sum game and we shouldn’t act like it (we also shouldn’t set up systems that encourage that view). The goal is to do good, meaningful work to the best of your ability. That’s it.</p><p>One more thing I can think of right now: it’s obviously important to believe deeply that your perspective and area of interest matters, but it’s also important to not let that belief lead to offhand dismissals of other perspectives, fields, or lines of work. There is value elsewhere. Other people can and will do incredibly interesting things. Hype is annoying, but there is usually something at least somewhat useful at its core. I think it’s important to try and balance singular belief and focus with an openness and respect for areas that are outside your own or even misaligned with your own. But like any other balancing act, it can be difficult.</p><h2>Whatever...</h2><p>At the end of the day, I’m just not sure how useful these kinds of talks really are. I think people will end up doing things that align with their values and that make them broadly happy. The hard part is trying to tease those values out. For the most part, generalized advice and guidance like the kind given in this talk don’t actually help with that.</p><p>If someone really cares about doing great research above all, at least in the way Hamming figures, they’ll figure out a lot of these things from the talk relatively naturally, on their own. At best, Hamming’s talk may resonate, provide validation, and help in some way for those people. But if someone cares deeply about nurturing their life outside of work, for example, there might not be much to take away. Perhaps the talk is even actively harmful. There is more to life than doing “great” research, by whatever standard Hamming is talking about. And that is perfectly OK.</p><p>There’s also a good deal of cynicism in the talk that I find distasteful. Human relationships are not just a means to end and shouldn’t be viewed as such. Conversations with peers have more value than simply “stimulating” your own thoughts. Saying “you can be a nice guy or you can be a great scientist” is simplistic at best and damaging at worst—being kind, generous, compassionate, and “nice” in the broad sense should be a prequisite for any sort of greatness. The “brilliant asshole” shtick in academia, and in computer science/programming more generally, needs to go.</p><p>There’s more to success than just some bar of research quality that Hamming has in mind or the kind of legacy that someone leaves behind. Legacy, public praise, and external prestige aren’t necessarily correlated to real, quality work or meaningful contribution. And being happy and fulfilled, I think, might be the most important thing. If you find that purely in doing research, great! But it’s OK to enjoy research and also want something more outside of that. It’s OK to not spend your entire life on your work. There’s always a tradeoff, but you can still add something worthwhile to the conversation.</p><p>I think there is a toxic undercurrent of constant comparison, overwork, and self-flagellation that runs in academia and that drives people away. We can do without that. At least I can.</p><p>And really, a talk like this just reveals the perspective of an individual. No matter how accomplished the individual, they have flaws, shortcomings, and blind spots. And like any other sort of advice, it should be taken with a hefty grain of salt.</p><h2>Some parting thoughts</h2><p>I’m going to try to hunker down and spend the next month or so continuing to learn more about SAT/SMT solvers and separation logic in hopes of doing some novel research on verifying concurrent data structures.</p><p>I’m pretty excited about it all. It continues to astonish me that there’s so much cool work being done, even in just a “niche” area like programming languages and verification.</p><p>Making a software developer salary is great, but my time is simply the most valuable thing I have right now. At least that’s how I feel at the moment. I guess this is sort of a privileged place to be in. I don’t know. But I do know I’m really happy right now spending my time learning about and working on all these things in the computer science research space that I find fascinating and important. I’m really grateful that I’m in a place to do this.</p><footer>♦♦♦</footer></body>
