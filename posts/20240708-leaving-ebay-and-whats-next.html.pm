◊post-title{Leaving eBay (and what's next)}
◊post-date{Monday July 8, 2024}

I officially left my full-time job at eBay last Friday! It's a weird and exciting time. And I have a lot of thoughts (probably too many).

I think it would be fun and good for me to start writing regularly, at least in this interstitial period between working and starting up school again. Most, if not all, the things I write about here will probably be related to programming languages, verification, software engineering, and computing more broadly.

I care about a number of other things outside of that umbrella, but I'd prefer to keep those parts of my life separate, at least online. For better or worse, I spend the bulk of my time these days doing programming and computer science things anyway.
