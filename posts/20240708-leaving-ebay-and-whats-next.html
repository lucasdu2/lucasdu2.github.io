  <h1>Leaving eBay (and what‚Äôs next)</h1><p class="post-date">Monday July 8, 2024</p><p>I officially left my full-time job at eBay last Friday! I‚Äôll be starting an MS program at UC Davis, probably at the beginning of 2025. It‚Äôs a weird and exciting time.</p><p>I think it would possibly be fun to start writing regularly, at least during this period between working and starting up school again. Most of the things I write about here will probably be related to programming languages, verification, software engineering, and computing more broadly. I also might not write anything at all. Who knows what the future holds?</p><h2>How I‚Äôm feeling now</h2><p>I think most modern software is in a terrible state.</p><p>This is in no way an indictment of eBay‚ÄîI had a really great experience working there as a new college graduate without much in the way of real world programming under my belt. I learned a ton. The people I worked with were incredibly smart and supportive. Everyone was doing the best they could with what they had at hand. I truly could not have asked for anything more.</p><p>But over the past couple years in industry, I‚Äôve become increasingly dissatisfied with the status quo. Most of the tools we work with‚Äîand more broadly, the software we work with‚Äîare massive agglutinations of hacks, patches, and historical accident. A lot of modern software development is comprised of meaningless tasks‚Äî<em>accidental</em> complexity, in the words of Fred Brooks‚Äîthat, in my view, are a direct result of an industry fetishization of ad hoc solutions, ‚Äúvelocity‚Äù, and profit-chasing. There‚Äôs only so far we can take this approach before we need to start taking a hard, principled look at the roots of our problems. At least that‚Äôs what I believe.</p><p>A common argument from an engineering perspective is that ‚Äúthings just work.‚Äù Who cares if it‚Äôs cobbled together and built on sand! But I really don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs true. Things <em>don‚Äôt</em> work. Not really. Software is brittle, incorrect, and laden with silent bugs that cause security issues and privacy leaks. Software is often unacceptably slow. No one really knows what‚Äôs going on with their systems and no one can really trust that their software won‚Äôt fail them. I don‚Äôt feel comfortable living in a world where ambitious people, intent on extracting ever-more monetary value from people, continue to inject software into larger and more important parts of our society when we can‚Äôt even trust that our software works well.</p><p>And it‚Äôs not just a skill issue. The solution isn‚Äôt just to tell people to ‚Äúget good.‚Äù The tools and abstractions we use are failing us. They could be doing much more. We should expect much more.</p><h2>What I want to do</h2><p>I‚Äôm still deeply excited about computing and software. I still think they have the potential to be incredibly powerful sources of good. But I think they often fall short of that promise, for reasons that are both social and technical. We can, and should, do much better.</p><p>I want to work on better tools and abstractions to broadly improve our software in technical ways‚Äîit should be easier to create software that is more correct, more secure, more private, more performant, and more flexible. We need better ways of wrangling ballooning complexity and developing more trustworthy, robust systems. We need better, more powerful ways to program computers.</p><p>I‚Äôm particularly interested in programming languages research and formal methods as avenues to effect the change I want to see. They give us more rigorous and principled ways to think about a lot of these problems. To me, they offer a degree of clarity, a bit of solid ground to stand on in a field that I think is still trying to figure itself out. I believe mathematical abstractions and logic have a lot to say when it comes to better ways of building and growing software.</p><p>I‚Äôm also interested in addressing systemic issues from the ground up, from a clean slate, if need be. I don‚Äôt want to hold onto outdated, ill-formed abstractions simply because they came first and they‚Äôre what we‚Äôre used to.</p><p>And I think the best way to do all of this is to go to graduate school. There just aren‚Äôt many places in industry that are accessible to me‚Äîat least, at the moment‚Äîthat are working on these kinds of problems in ways that I find satisfying and meaningful. There certainly aren‚Äôt many places in industry that offer the degree of intellectual freedom that I want at the moment. There‚Äôs just more tolerance for uncertainty and experimentation in academia. There‚Äôs more leeway to take big, hopeful swings. There‚Äôs more room to explore and do work on things that don‚Äôt necessarily have immediate business value.</p><p>I‚Äôve also just become extremely intellectually interested in the academic work going on at the intersection of programming languages, formal methods, and systems. I want a way to spend more time getting to engage with that work and I think that‚Äôs something graduate school is tailor-made for.</p><p>We‚Äôll see what happens though. There are lots of things that aren‚Äôt so nice about academia too‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs toxic power dynamics, politics, or the incessant pressure to publish. And of course, as in any other highly competitive field, a path in academia isn‚Äôt guaranteed (to say the least). There are other factors at play. That honestly might be one of the hardest realizations of growing up: sometimes, no matter how hard you try and how badly you want something, you just won‚Äôt get it. Or you‚Äôll get it and realize it‚Äôs not what you truly wanted.</p><p>But I‚Äôm going to give it a shot. Why not? As the youths of a bygone era once said, YOLO.

Ideally, this correction would happen at the time of software construction. At the very least, we need fewer post-hoc, unprincipled fixes to things, something I believe our tools and abstractions can help us with.<a href="#1_fn">‚Ü©</a></li><li id="2_fnref">To be totally fair though, human intent and execution are both fundamentally imperfect. While we should be less accepting of software bugs, we should still always strive to be kind to ourselves (and more generally, the human part of the process)! The answer to all of this is not to punish programmers more for making mistakes. Instead, it's to recognize that our tools should be helping us make fewer mistakes and to demand more of the software artifacts we produce and use.<a href="#2_fn">‚Ü©</a></li><li id="3_fnref">OK, maybe this is a little too strident. Sometimes you do need to accept your reality, no matter how terrible, if you want to remain sane. But I do stand by my point that you don't need to celebrate it. That just feels like blatant Stockholm syndrome.<a href="#3_fn">‚Ü©</a></li><li id="3.1_fnref">For reference, take any inference rule style presentation of Andersen's algorithm, which should be accessible with a quick web search or LLM query üôÉ<a href="#3.1_fn">‚Ü©</a></li><li id="4_fnref">Since BFS is technically linear time, for example, or more specifically $\mathcal{O}(V+E)$ for some graph $G = (V, E)$. Or an appeal to Wikipedia citations <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reachability#cite_note-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.<a href="#4_fn">‚Ü©</a></li><li id="1.5_fnref">In all fairness, this is probably true of most jobs. But I do feel like there is something particularly soul-draining about corporate software jobs.<a href="#1.5_fn">‚Ü©</a></li><li id="5_fnref">But I don't know. Here's a bit of a rant. <em>Some opinions, beliefs, and values are just fundamentally misaligned.</em> And I don't necessarily think Recurse is entirely immune to that fact. There's a reason I'm choosing to leave the software industry, at least for now. I'm tired of the endless cycles of hype-chasing and profit-seeking, the maddening rat race ("Why doesn't your 5-year-old know how to code!!" or "I did 1000 LeetCode questions and you must too!!!"), the corporate brand worship ("I'm an ex-FAANG early hire at Notion please fund my AI startup"), the latent arrogance in Silicon Valley culture, and so on. No, your startup is probably not going to disrupt, or "innovate," or change the world in any way that actually matters. It's time that we all stop pretending we know how to program effectively (and all we need are some LLMs or a better JS framework to make things easier) or that software has a good answer to all of our problems. Providing real value to the world is often not correlated to profitability. You don't have to major in computer science. It's going to be OK.<a href="#5_fn">‚Ü©</a></li></ol></section><footer>‚ô¶‚ô¶‚ô¶</footer></body>
