◊post-title{Life on the farm}
◊post-date{Sunday March 16, 2025}

It's been three months and the quarter is basically over, so here are some entirely unsolicited thoughts on being back at school for the first time in several years! It's definitely been an adjustment. But life is pretty good overall. I certainly can't complain.

◊post-section{My own time}
There's so much more freedom in academic/school life than full-time working life in that I only have, at most, a couple classes a day and most of my time is my own. I guess I technically own all of my time at the moment, since no one is paying me to do anything (for better or worse). Everything is something that I signed up for and that I actually want to do (for the most part). That's been really nice.

◊post-section{Post-grad nostalgia}
I've seen a ◊link["https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NarJ2YKgnvk&t=474s"]{couple} ◊link["https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2HjCgmPh00"]{videos} on YouTube recently where some recent graduates talk about the emotional challenges of leaving school and joining the workforce outside academia. I don't really remember exactly how I felt when I first graduated and started my job, but I don't think I felt ◊em{quite} as bad initially. I do remember being very burnt out of school and generally pretty happy that I had a job that paid me real money. I was also back home in a place where a lot of my friends still were, so I didn't necessarily feel all that lonely.

That said, I do generally relate quite a bit to those general feelings of aimlessness and lack of meaning in post-grad life. It's weird---and I certainly don't think that going back to school is the answer, almost ever---but school does sort of impose this sense of rhythm and direction to life that feels like an important part of being human. You're always making forward progress in some way and your life is demarcated fairly rigidly (sometimes too rigidly) by that sense of progress and by the seasons: there's an arc to every class, in the milestones you have to hit, and the breaks that come at regular intervals.

You also really do feel like part of a larger community. For most students, you spend lots of time with your peers, you have similar things to work on and similar struggles, and your vacations are, by default, perfectly aligned. You often live close to your friends and have common places to hang out.

A lot of that ends up being hard to find after graduation. Those kinds of things---having a rhythm and a certain structure to your life, feeling a sense of progress and forward movement, and being part of a community---are things that you have to end up finding or making for yourself.

For the most part though, being employed, especially outside academia, has a lot of upsides. You get a whole new degree of freedom from having your own income, which is usually higher than what you would get in the academic world. Depending on your profession and field, you often have more say in where you live and work. Generally, I think that most of post-grad malaise has nothing to do with school in particular; it's more about being dropped (rather abruptly) into a new stage of life in which very little of the social and mental structure you've built up over the past 20-odd years of school apply anymore. It's not ◊em{school} that you miss, but rather the routines, built-in sense of purpose, and social community that comes with being in school. Finding your way again has a lot to do with figuring out those things again in a non-school context.

But I don't really know. I think I definitely did actually miss school itself, particularly the intellectual environment and also the ability to spend most of your time learning interesting things (more or less). For all the industry talk about how a software developer job is exciting because ◊em{it's all about continuous learning (!!!)}, I don't think that's actually true, or at least not any more than any other job. To the extent that it ◊em{is} true, the stuff you're actually learning is usually not particularly interesting (in my view). It's usually just whatever new thing that's trendy or arbitrarily hyped up---it's almost never something that is fundamentally meaningful.

Also, I ◊em{am} back at school so...take this all with a grain of salt.

◊post-subsection{Nice things about ◊em{not} being in school}
In hindsight, there were some really, really positive things about taking some time to work in industry before going back to school.
◊items{
  ◊item{The biggest one is that I just had absolute freedom to explore things that I found interesting in my free time outside of work. That's a big reason (actually, the main reason) I even got into programming languages research in the first place and even started thinking about going back to school.}
  ◊item{I don't think I would have realized I thought this stuff was interesting in a super structured school environment because: A) there are usually a ton of other academic requirements to get through, regardless of how interesting I find them, that can take up most of my brain space and my energy; B) there often (at least in the US) aren't many programming languages/verification/logic/semantics classes being offered and not every school has active programming languages research happening that I'm excited about.}
  ◊item{I got a sense of some real problems with software in industry that has ended up informing a lot of my research interests. In particular, I'm not sure if I would have found PL theory and formal methods as important or as cool if not for my experience as a professional software developer.}
  ◊item{I had enough time to figure out what I liked about working and what I found unacceptable, which definitely makes me feel less FOMO about leaving my job and going back to school. I think there are a good number of graduate students that feel like they're really missing out on some kind of glorious life in industry that they could have had. It's good that I don't feel like this, for the most part, since I did my time (for a while) as a software developer.}

◊aside{As an aside, I have a few people to thank for my interest in PL and academic research. In particular: ◊link["https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~lkuper/"]{Lindsey Kuper} and ◊link["http://adam.chlipala.net/"]{Adam Chlipala}. Stumbling upon their web pages and seeing the sort of work they were doing was super, super inspiring for me. In some ways, it changed my life. There is something that can be said, I think, about research as an ◊em{aesthetic} pursuit and not just a ◊em{scientific} one---I certainly think that the aesthetic of research that both Lindsey Kuper and Adam Chlipala (along with many other people in the PL community) nurture was what really captivated me. The kinds of problems you care about, the things you choose to work on, and the sort of visions you pursue all have just as much to do with your sense of aesthetics and your values as it does with some objective pursuit of truth. Maybe I'll think more and write more about this at some point.}

◊post-section{Some notes to self}
◊items{
  ◊item{Saying "no" is a delicate art, but an important one. There are simply too many things that I possibly want to do and too little time/personal ability to do it all. That's OK! It's really important to do the things you can realistically do and say no to the things that you can't realistically do. It's hard to remain sane otherwise.}
  ◊item{It's OK (and actually pretty critical) to have some kind of balance. When I was working, any time I could spend reading papers, books, or doing research-y things was purely for fun. If I could sneak any of it at all, I was pretty happy. But now that I've started back at school (and left my job and a steady income), it feels like I need to do all of it, all the time, to make it "worth it" in some warped way. This has definitely...not been healthy.}
  ◊item{I guess the most important thing is to remember that the ◊em{whole point} is to have fun and enjoy things. That's why I quit my job. That's why I'm doing this whole academia thing. I think it's more fun and more fulfilling. I really don't want to lose sight of that. Try to remain humble and curious. Try to enjoy it as much as you can!}

◊post-section{Minor asides}
Davis is ◊em{extremely} different from NYC (who would have thought!), but it's still been quite nice in its own way. There's so much open space, which I've definitely missed in the cities that I've lived in. And if I want to be around a bunch of people, downtown Davis is pretty lively most days. Is it as exciting as NYC? Definitely not. But it has its charm. It really does smell like animal poop (cow poop, I guess?) a lot though. People were not lying about that.
