◊post-date{Wednesday August 7, 2024}

It's been about a month since I quit my programming job to be a full-time unemployed bum. I wanted to have some time to myself where I could step off the corporate hamster wheel --- a wheel that I've found increasingly little value in --- and just do things that I wanted to do. I wanted to have more time to work on research and more time to have fun with my friends. Working full time just wasn't conducive to doing both those things.

As an aside, money is definitely great and extremely important, but the most valuable thing to me right now is my time. It would take a hefty sum at the moment to get me to spend my time on something I don't find personally meaningful and/or intellectually interesting. Maybe one day that will change. Maybe this is a disgustingly privileged perspective. I don't know. But that's just how I feel right now.

I also don't think I'm alone in feeling this way. There's a reason why many young-ish people are so annoyed with the state of higher education or the expectations of a 9-5 job. Maybe we're just spoiled. Or maybe there's just a good deal of undiagnosed Stockholm syndrome going around? Regardless, those are thoughts for another time.

Anyway, so far I've definitely been a lot happier! It's extremely freeing to have time to yourself, without forced obligations (who would have thought?). But it also turns out that having copious amounts of free time to pursue personal interests comes with its own set of difficulties.

◊post-section{Focus and Freedom}
It's been fairly difficult for me to find my bearing without forced structure, particularly when I have so many things I want to spend time on. I don't really want to waste these precious months of absolute freedom, whatever ◊em{waste} means to me.

I do have some high-level goals of A) digging more deeply into programming languages research in preparation for graduate school, B) doing fun programming things that I didn't have time for previously (perhaps related to programming languages/distributed systems research), and C) spending more time with people that I care about.

But it's been shockingly easy to fall into doing lots of broad, unfocused work that I don't feel like I'm getting much out of. And it's also been fairly easy to put off seeing my friends and doing fun things outside of computers/programming because I either feel like I haven't done enough work for the day or I feel like I could be doing more.

If I end up doing a PhD, self-directed work and lots of unstructured time are (probably) going to be the status quo. This is, in many ways, what I want! But I also need to figure out ways to direct myself so that I can make real progress on things that matter to me, while still making time for the things outside of "work" that make me happy and whole.

Having easy access to the internet also doesn't help. It's very easy for me to go down these long rabbit holes into things that are tangentially relevant to my interests. And there are just so many resources out there on so many cool things! Something I need to work on is just putting on a pair of blinders and doing the things that are most important to me right now. You can't do everything and you can't know everything. That's okay. Do the things you can do and enjoy it. That's the whole damn point.

I think that allotting a set amount of time a week to look at the bigger picture, think broadly about things, and explore tangential interests could be valuable. There's a tendency for those things to spiral indefinitely for me, and I think blocking out limited time for them could keep me in check and keep me moving forward on the hard, immediate things that require my attention (particularly when there's no external pressure to keep me moving forward on those hard, immediate things).
