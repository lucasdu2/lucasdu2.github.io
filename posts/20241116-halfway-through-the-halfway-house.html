  <h1>Halfway through the halfway house</h1><p class="post-date">Saturday November 16, 2024</p><p>I’m currently doing a batch at the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Recurse Center</a> in Brooklyn. I’m just a little over the halfway point and it feels like a good time to write down some brief thoughts on how things are going and how I’m feeling.</p><h2>The halfway house</h2><p>The reality of industry software development is, at least in my view, quite bleak—a lot of people feel trapped in industry jobs<sup><a href="#1_fnref" id="1_fn">(1)</a></sup> that slowly sap away their passion and love for the craft.<sup><a href="#1.5_fnref" id="1.5_fn">(2)</a></sup></p><p>Some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GZdeWWraTs&amp;pp=ygUcdHNvZGluZyBpbmR1c3RyeSBwcm9ncmFtbWluZw%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">people</a> far more experienced than I go as far as to claim that most paid software development work isn’t really <em>programming</em>. I guess it depends what you would count as “programming”—and it’s possible to be quite gate-keepy about it, which isn’t necessarily great—but, in my (limited) experience, there is some truth there: the kinds of software work done in companies, particularly big companies, is usually just not very fun or very interesting (in both a “is it intellectually stimulating?” sense and a “are we making cool things?” sense).</p><p>There’s a lot of ink that could be spilled about this state of affairs, but I think it suffices to say that even if you really enjoy programming and/or computer science, or perhaps even <em>because</em> of that enjoyment, it’s hard to not get burnt out by the industry grind. Software is often an enormous mess, both technically and socially. There are a lot of things that conspire against a desire to <strong>just create cool stuff that works well</strong>.<sup><a href="#2_fnref" id="2_fn">(3)</a></sup><sup><a href="#3_fnref" id="3_fn">(4)</a></sup></p><p>The best part about Recurse is that I get to hang out with a bunch of people who A) are excited about programming and computing and B) want to share that excitement in ways that edify others. It’s refreshing. As far as I can tell, it’s rare. And I think Recurse does an <a href="https://www.recurse.com/social-rules" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">excellent</a> <a href="https://www.recurse.com/self-directives" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">job</a> of creating and fostering this sort of community.</p><p>I do think that if I were planning on going back to industry afterwards, I wouldn’t feel quite as negatively about it all. There are cool things being done (although they’re not always easy to find). There are people who respect their work and who hold values that also matter deeply to me. It’s not all hype-chasing, profiteering, and grift.<sup><a href="#5_fnref" id="5_fn">(5)</a></sup></p><h2>Up next</h2><p>Graduate school, or at least a PhD, feels like an extension of the Recurse environment in the sense that it can be (at its best) self-directed and curiosity-driven. You can have the freedom to <strong>do cool stuff</strong> and <strong>make things meaningfully better</strong>. I’m excited by that—that’s really the core of what I want.</p><p>I hope I don’t lose the excitement and love I have for all of this stuff when it becomes my job, or at least when it becomes the main thing that I <em>have</em> to do. That’s my biggest worry. But it’s hard to tell what the future will bring. There will always be ups and downs and moments of darkness. But if, at some point, I do end up feeling burnt out and tired of it all...perhaps I’ll just come back to Recurse for a bit.</p><section class="footnotes"><ol><li id="1_fnref">Jobs that are, admittedly, usually very well-paid. There are certainly worse things.<a href="#1_fn">↩</a></li><li id="1.5_fnref">In all fairness, this is probably true of most jobs. But I do feel like there is something particularly soul-draining about corporate software jobs.<a href="#1.5_fn">↩</a></li><li id="2_fnref">For one, working in industry will open your eyes to the fact that most things are 1) not very cool and 2) not working very well. But, of course, take this possibly naive opinion with grain of salt.<a href="#2_fn">↩</a></li><li id="3_fnref">There are probably more things that conspire against the desire to make software <em>that's actually good for people</em>.<a href="#3_fn">↩</a></li><li id="5_fnref">But I don't know. Here's a bit of a rant. <em>Some opinions, beliefs, and values are just fundamentally misaligned.</em> And I don't necessarily think Recurse is entirely immune to that fact. There's a reason I'm choosing to leave the software industry, at least for now. I'm tired of the endless cycles of hype-chasing and profit-seeking, the maddening rat race ("Why doesn't your 5-year-old know how to code!!" or "I did 1000 LeetCode questions and you must too!!!"), the corporate brand worship ("I'm an ex-FAANG early hire at Notion please fund my AI startup"), the latent arrogance in Silicon Valley culture, and so on. No, your startup is probably not going to disrupt, or "innovate," or change the world in any way that actually matters. It's time that we all stop pretending we know how to program effectively (and all we need are some LLMs or a better JS framework to make things easier) or that software has a good answer to all of our problems. Providing real value to the world is often not correlated to profitability. You don't have to major in computer science. It's going to be OK.<a href="#5_fn">↩</a></li></ol></section><footer>Questions? Comments? Corrections? Email me at lzdu ∊ ucdavis [dot] edu!</footer></body>
