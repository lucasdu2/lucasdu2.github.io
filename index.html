        <p>Currently, I'm employed as a Technical Consultant at
        <a href="https://www.hitachivantara.com/en-us/home.html" target="_blank"
           rel="noopener noreferrer">Hitachi Vantara</a>. I work on cloud storage 
           at <a href="https://www.ebay.com/" target="_blank" 
           rel="noopener noreferrer">eBay</a>.</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> I graduated from the 
            <a href="https://www.uchicago.edu/"
               target="_blank"
               rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Chicago</a> 
        (BS ‘21) with a degree in
        computer science and a minor in creative writing. I love both these things
        (computer science/programming, reading/writing/literature) and I believe 
        that, in many ways, they are not so different.</p>

        <p>As a software engineer, I want to make things that are fast, robust, and 
        fun to use. I'm particularly fascinated by the guts of software—the parts 
        of code that run behind the scenes and make things tick. I'm also passionate 
        about software for social and environmental good.
        </p>
        <p> Within computer science, I'm broadly interested in distributed 
        systems. I hope to do work that makes distributed systems more reliable, 
        more secure, more empowering to the user, and generally more positively 
        impactful. 
        </p>
        <p>More specifically, I'm very interested in abstractions
           and techniques that make it easier to write correct and efficient 
           distributed software. I believe that our tools could be helping us much
           more in writing error-free, understandable, and high performance programs.</p>
        <p>I also like reading short stories, writing fiction, and listening to music, 
           although those interests, unfortunately, are not as profitable as software.</p>
