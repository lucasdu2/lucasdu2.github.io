      <h2>About</h2>
      <p> I graduated from the 
          <a href="https://www.uchicago.edu/"
             target="_blank"
             rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Chicago</a> 
      (BS ‘21) with a degree in
      computer science and a minor in creative writing. I love making things 
      that are fast, robust, and fun to use. I'm particularly fascinated by the 
      guts of software—the parts of code that run behind the scenes and make 
      things tick. I'm also passionate about software for social and 
      environmental good.
      </p>
      <p> Within computer science, I'm primarily interested in distributed 
      systems, networks, computer privacy/security (especially in large 
      distributed systems), and parallel computing. I'm also interested in the 
      mathematical provability of algorithms, such as provable correctness in 
      distributed systems and provable privacy. I hope to do work that makes 
      distributed systems more usable, more secure, and more positively impactful.
