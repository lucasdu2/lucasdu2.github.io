I’m currently taking a brief break between working full-time and starting up school again.</p><p>Previously, I worked on cloud storage at eBay. As an undergraduate, I studied computer science at UChicago.</p><p>I’m interested in <strong>programming languages</strong> and <strong>formal methods research</strong> to <em>improve</em> the quality of software systems and <em>make it easier</em> to develop higher quality software. Software should be more empowering and less frustrating for both developers and users.</p><h2>Research Interests</h2><p>Currently, I’m interested in the <strong>formal verification of concurrent and distributed systems</strong>. I want strong formal guarantees, specifically about correctness and security, from performance-sensitive foundational systems (i.e. databases, filesystems, browsers) and web-based applications.</p><p>I’m also interested in <strong>better programming models for parallel and distributed computing</strong>. We need better tools and abstractions to make building simple and efficient (and correct, secure, and private) parallel/concurrent/distributed software much easier.</p><hr/><p>Broadly, I believe practical software development can be much more rigorous and elegant. Programming languages and formal methods offer a theoretically rich and principled place to start. There is a lot of room for mathematical abstractions to give us far better results across the computing stack and as software underpins more and more of our lives, <em>we need better results</em>.</p><footer>made with robotic indifference by yours truly, with help from <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/pollen/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pollen</a></footer></body>
