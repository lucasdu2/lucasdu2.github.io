<body><header><h1>Lucas Du</h1><nav><a href="index.html">Home</a><a href="writing.html">Writing</a></nav></header><h2>About</h2><p><img src="assets/myface.jpg" alt="a picture of my face" class="portrait"/> I am an <strong>incoming Computer Science MS student at UC Davis</strong>. I’m currently taking a brief break between working full-time and starting school.</p><p>Previously, I was a Technical Consultant at Hitachi Vantara, working on cloud storage at eBay. Even before that, I graduated from the University of Chicago (BS ‘21) with a degree in computer science and a minor in English and creative writing.</p><p>I’m interested in <strong>programming languages</strong> and <strong>formal methods research</strong> to <em>improve</em> the quality of software systems and <em>make it easier</em> to develop higher quality software. Software should be more empowering and less frustrating for both developers and users.</p><p>More broadly, I’m interested in moving software away from heuristics and hacks and onto more solid, elegant, and principled ground. I think there is a lot of room for mathematical abstractions to give us much better results across the computing stack. And as software worms its way into more of our lives, we need better results.</p><p>You can reach me at <mark><em>lzdu (at) ucdavis</em></mark>. I am also on <a href="https://github.com/lucasdu2">Github</a> and <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/lucaszdu">LinkedIn</a>.</p><h2>Research Interests</h2><p>I’m primarily interested in <strong>applying techniques from programming languages and formal methods to software systems</strong>. I’m currently excited about:</p><ul><li><p><strong>verification of concurrent/distributed systems</strong> and</p></li><li><p><strong>better programming models for the cloud</strong>, particularly related to distributed storage and stream processing.</p></li></ul><h2>Personal</h2><p>I like reading short stories, writing fiction, and listening to music. I also like long form journalism and literary criticism. At one point, I wanted to be a journalist. At another point, I wanted to be a writer. I generally like a lot of humanities-related things and it’s unfortunate that market forces have deemed most of them to be strictly less valuable than producing software.</p><footer>made with robotic indifference by yours truly, with help from <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/pollen/index.html">pollen</a></footer></body>
