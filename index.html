  <h2>About</h2><p><img src="assets/myface.jpg" alt="a picture of my face" class="portrait"/> I am an <strong>incoming computer science MS student at UC Davis</strong>. I’m currently taking a brief break between working full-time and starting up school again.</p><p>Previously, I worked on cloud storage at eBay. As an undergraduate, I studied computer science at UChicago.</p><p>I’m interested in <strong>programming languages</strong> and <strong>formal methods research</strong> to <em>improve</em> the quality of software systems and <em>make it easier</em> to develop higher quality software. Software should be more empowering and less frustrating for both developers and users.</p><p><email>lzdu ∊ ucdavis</email> ∨ <email>lucaszdu ∊ gmail</email> / <a href="https://github.com/lucasdu2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a> / <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/lucaszdu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a></p><h2>Research Interests</h2><p>Currently, I’m interested in the <strong>formal verification of concurrent and distributed systems</strong>. I’m also interested in <strong>better programming models for parallel and distributed computing</strong>.</p><p>I generally want to take a <strong>programming languages and formal methods approach to improving software systems</strong>. It should be easier to create software—particularly concurrent and distributed software—that is more correct, efficient, secure, private, and flexible. Programming languages and formal methods offer a theoretically rich and principled place to start.</p><footer>made with robotic indifference by yours truly, with help from <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/pollen/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pollen</a></footer></body>
