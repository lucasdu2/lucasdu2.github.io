Even before that, I graduated from the University of Chicago (BS ‘21) with a degree in computer science and a minor in English and creative writing.</p><p>I’m interested in <strong>programming languages</strong> and <strong>formal methods research</strong> to <strong>improve the quality of software systems</strong> and <strong>make it easier to develop higher quality software</strong>. Software should be more empowering and less frustrating for both developers and users.</p><p>More broadly, I’m interested in moving software development away from heuristics and hacks and onto more solid, elegant, and principled ground. I think there is a lot of room for mathematical abstractions to give us much better results across the computing stack.</p><h2>Research Interests</h2><p>I’m primarily interested in <strong>applying techniques from programming languages and formal methods to software systems</strong>. I’m currently excited about:</p><ul><li><p><strong>verification of concurrent/distributed systems</strong> and</p></li><li><p><strong>better programming models for the cloud</strong>, particularly related to distributed storage and stream processing.</p></li></ul><p>I’m also generally interested in functional programming, compilers, type systems, web browsers, scientific and high performance computing, databases, security and cryptography, peer-to-peer and decentralized systems, data privacy, program synthesis, and so on. But life is finite. I do hope that anything I do with computers centers on some subset of these interests.</p><h2>Personal</h2><p>I like reading short stories, writing fiction, and listening to music. I also like long form journalism and literary criticism. At one point, I wanted to be a journalist. At another point, I wanted to be a writer. I like a lot of humanities-related things and it’s unfortunate that market forces have deemed most of them to be strictly less valuable than producing software.</p><footer>made with robotic indifference by yours truly, with help from <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/pollen/index.html">pollen</a></footer></body>
