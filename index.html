        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm employed as a Technical Consultant at
        <a href="https://www.hitachivantara.com/en-us/home.html" target="_blank"
           rel="noopener noreferrer">Hitachi Vantara</a>. I work on cloud storage 
           at <a href="https://www.ebay.com/" target="_blank" 
           rel="noopener noreferrer">eBay</a>.</p>
        <p> I graduated from the 
            <a href="https://www.uchicago.edu/"
               target="_blank"
               rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Chicago</a> 
        (BS ‘21) with a degree in
        computer science and a minor in creative writing. I love both these things
        (computer science/programming, reading/writing/literature) and I believe 
        that, in many ways, they are not so different.</p>


        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>As a software engineer, I'm fascinated by the guts of software—the parts 
        of code that run behind the scenes and make things tick. I'm also passionate 
        about non-harmful software for social and environmental good. Software
        should strive to be empowering, not to quietly exploit people and 
        perpetuate inequity for profit.
        </p>
        <p> Within computer science, I'm broadly interested in more reliable,
        more performant, more secure, and more private distributed systems. It
        should generally be much easier to create high-quality, user-empowering 
        concurrent and connected software. I believe we can accomplish this goal 
        through more effective abstractions and techniques at a systems level,
        in our programming languages, operating systems, and databases.</p>

        <p>Currently, some specific interests are:
          <ul>
            <li><b>Applications of formal methods to practical software</b>, 
            particularly distributed software</li>
            <li><b>Better programming models for the cloud</b>, especially related to
            distributed storage</li>
            <li><b>Type systems</b> for <b>concurrent, distributed software</b></li>
            <li><b>Software synthesis</b> and <b>verification</b></li>
            <li>Techniques for <b>private data analysis</b></li>
            <li>Verification of <b>trustworthy AI/ML system</b></li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>I also like reading short stories, writing fiction, and listening to 
        music, among other things. Unfortunately, market forces have deemed
        most of those interests to be strictly less valuable than producing software.</p>
