Previously, I was a Technical Consultant at Hitachi Vantara, working on cloud storage at eBay. Even before that, I graduated from the University of Chicago (BS ‘21) with a degree in computer science and a minor in English and creative writing.</p><p>I’m interested in <strong>programming languages</strong> and <strong>formal methods research</strong> to both <strong>improve the quality of software systems</strong> and <strong>make it easier to develop higher quality software</strong>. More broadly, I’m interested in moving software development away from heuristics and hacks and onto solid, principled ground.</p><h2>Research Interests</h2><p>I’m primarily interested in <strong>applying techniques from programming languages and formal methods to software systems</strong>. My interests within this umbrella are fairly varied, but I’m currently excited about <strong>verification of concurrent/distributed systems</strong> and <strong>better programming models for the cloud</strong>, particularly related to distributed storage and stream processing.</p><p>I’m also generally interested in compilers, type systems, web browsers, scientific and high performance computing, security and cryptography, peer-to-peer and decentralized systems, data privacy, program synthesis, and so on. But life is finite. I do hope that anything I do with computers centers on some subset of these interests.</p><p>At a much higher and more idealistic level, I’m interested in software that is <strong>more empowering</strong> and <strong>less exploitative, extractive, or otherwise harmful</strong>. I want software that adds more to our lives and our world than it takes away.</p><h2>Personal</h2><p>I like reading short stories, writing fiction, and listening to music. I also like long form journalism and literary criticism. At one point I wanted to be a journalist. At another point, I wanted to be a writer. I like a lot of humanities-related things and it’s unfortunate that market forces have deemed most of them to be strictly less valuable than producing software.</p><footer>made with robotic indifference by yours truly, with help from <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/pollen/index.html">pollen</a></footer></body>
