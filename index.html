        <p>Currently, I'm employed as a Technical Consultant at
        <a href="https://www.hitachivantara.com/en-us/home.html" target="_blank"
           rel="noopener noreferrer">Hitachi Vantara</a>. I work on cloud storage 
           at <a href="https://www.ebay.com/" target="_blank" 
           rel="noopener noreferrer">eBay</a>.</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> I graduated from the 
            <a href="https://www.uchicago.edu/"
               target="_blank"
               rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Chicago</a> 
        (BS ‘21) with a degree in
        computer science and a minor in creative writing. I love both these things
        (computer science/programming, reading/writing/literature) and I believe 
        that, in many ways, they are not so different.</p>

        <p>As a software engineer, I want to make things that are fast, robust, and 
        fun to use. I'm particularly fascinated by the guts of software—the parts 
        of code that run behind the scenes and make things tick. I'm also passionate 
        about non-harmful software for social and environmental good. Software
        should strive to be empowering, not to quietly exploit people and 
        perpetuate inequity for profit.
        </p>

        <p> Within computer science, I'm broadly interested in more reliable,
        more performant, more secure, and more private distributed systems. 
        I'm specifically interested in more effective abstractions and techniques
        to make it much easier to write correct and efficient software, particularly
        concurrent, distributed software. I believe that our tools should 
        be helping us much more in writing error-free, understandable, and high 
        performance programs, and also that there is an increasingly dire need for such 
        tools as software embeds itself more deeply into the fabric of our lives.</p>

        <p>I also like reading short stories, writing fiction, and listening to 
        music, among other things. Unfortunately, market forces have deemed
        most of those interests to be strictly less valuable than producing software.</p>
