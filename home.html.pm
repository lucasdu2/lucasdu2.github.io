◊headline{About}

◊portrait["assets/myface.jpg" "a picture of my face"] I am an MS student at UC Davis studying computer science. Previously, I was a Technical Consultant at Hitachi Vantara, working on cloud storage at eBay. Even before that, I graduated from the University of Chicago (BS '21) with a degree in computer science and a minor in English and creative writing.

I'm interested in ◊strong{programming languages} and ◊strong{formal methods research} to both ◊strong{improve the quality of software systems} and ◊strong{make it easier to develop higher quality software}. More broadly, I'm interested in moving software development away from heuristics and hacks and onto solid, principled ground.

◊headline{Research Interests}
I'm primarily interested in ◊strong{applying techniques from programming languages and formal methods to software systems}. My interests within this umbrella are fairly varied, but I'm currently excited about ◊strong{verification of concurrent/distributed systems} and ◊strong{better programming models for the cloud}, particularly related to distributed storage and stream processing.

I'm also generally interested in compilers, type systems, web browsers, scientific and high performance computing, security and cryptography, peer-to-peer and decentralized systems, data privacy, program synthesis, and so on. But life is finite. I do hope that anything I do with computers centers on some subset of these interests.

At a much higher and more idealistic level, I'm interested in software that is ◊strong{more empowering} and ◊strong{less exploitative, extractive, or otherwise harmful}. I want software that adds more to our lives and our world than it takes away. 

◊headline{Personal}
I like reading short stories, writing fiction, and listening to music. I also like long form journalism and literary criticism. At one point I wanted to be a journalist. At another point, I wanted to be a writer. I like a lot of humanities-related things and it's unfortunate that market forces have deemed most of them to be strictly less valuable than producing software.
