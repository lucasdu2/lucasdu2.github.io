◊headline{About}

◊portrait["assets/myface.jpg" "a picture of my face"] I am an ◊strong{incoming computer science MS student at UC Davis}. I'm currently taking a brief break between working full-time and starting up school again.

Previously, I worked on cloud storage at eBay. As an undergraduate, I studied computer science at UChicago.

I'm interested in ◊strong{programming languages} and ◊strong{formal methods research} to ◊em{improve} the quality of software systems and ◊em{make it easier} to develop higher quality software. Software should be more empowering and less frustrating for both developers and users.

◊headline{Research Interests}
Currently, I'm interested in the ◊strong{formal verification of concurrent and distributed systems}. I'm also interested in ◊strong{better programming models for parallel and distributed computing}.

I generally want to take a programming languages and formal methods approach to improving software systems. It should be easier to create software --- particularly concurrent and distributed software --- that is more correct, efficient, secure, private, and flexible. Programming languages and formal methods offer a theoretically rich and principled place to start.
