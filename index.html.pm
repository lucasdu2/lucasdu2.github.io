◊portrait["assets/myface.jpg" "a picture of my face"] I am an ◊strong{incoming computer science MS student at UC Davis}. I'm currently taking a brief break between working full-time and starting up school again.

Previously, I worked on cloud storage at eBay. As an undergraduate, I studied computer science at UChicago.

I'm interested in ◊strong{programming languages} and ◊strong{formal methods research} to ◊em{improve} the quality of software systems and ◊em{make it easier} to develop higher quality software. Software should be more empowering and less frustrating for both developers and users.

◊headline{Research Interests}
Currently, I'm interested in the ◊strong{formal verification of concurrent and distributed systems}. I'm also interested in ◊strong{better programming models for parallel and distributed computing}.

I generally want to make it easier to create software --- particularly concurrent and distributed software --- that is more correct, secure, private, efficient, and flexible. I believe practical software development can be much more rigorous and elegant. Programming languages and formal methods offer a theoretically rich and principled place to start.

Broadly, I believe there is a lot of room for mathematical abstractions to give us much better results across the computing stack. And as software underpins more and more of our lives, we need better results.
