◊portrait["assets/myface.jpg" "a picture of my face"] I am a computer science MS student at ◊link["https://cs.ucdavis.edu/graduate/graduate-group"]{UC Davis}, advised by ◊link["https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~cdstanford/"]{Caleb Stanford}. Previously, I worked on cloud storage at ◊link["https://innovation.ebayinc.com/tech/engineering/"]{eBay}. Even before that, I was an undergraduate at ◊link["https://cs.uchicago.edu/"]{UChicago}.

I like ◊strong{programming languages}, ◊strong{formal methods}, and applications of techniques from these areas to (concurrency ∪ distribution) and (security ∪ privacy). I aim to develop mathematically principled, language-oriented tools and abstractions for building ◊em{provably correct}, ◊em{efficient}, ◊em{flexible}, and ◊em{simple} software, preferably ◊em{by-construction}.

Final project for ECS235B at UC Davis (Spring 2025).}◊item-description[◊link["files/milner-processes.pdf"]{"Processes: A Mathematical Model of Computing Agents" (Milner 1973)}]{A scan of Robin Milner's paper, which appeared in the Proceedings of the Logic Colloqium (Bristol, July 1973). It contains some early ideas of what would later become CCS and the pi-calculus. I wasn't able to find a copy online anywhere else, so here it is.}}
