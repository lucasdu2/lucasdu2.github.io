◊portrait["assets/myface.jpg" "a picture of my face"] I am a computer science MS student at ◊link["https://cs.ucdavis.edu/graduate/graduate-group"]{UC Davis}, advised by ◊link["https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~cdstanford/"]{Caleb Stanford}. Previously, I worked on cloud storage at ◊link["https://innovation.ebayinc.com/tech/engineering/"]{eBay}. Even before that, I was an undergraduate at ◊link["https://cs.uchicago.edu/"]{UChicago}.

I like ◊strong{programming languages}, ◊strong{formal methods}, and applications of techniques from these areas to (concurrency ∪ distribution) and (security ∪ privacy). I aim to develop mathematically principled, language-oriented tools and abstractions for building ◊em{correct}, ◊em{efficient}, ◊em{flexible}, and ◊em{simple} software, preferably ◊em{by-construction}, on solid theoretical foundations.

◊section{Research interests}
I am currently interested in (a) ◊underline{type systems, semantics, and language runtimes} for verified and efficient ◊em{distributed stream processing}; and (b) ◊underline{principled automated testing and foundational verification} of ◊em{linear-time regex engines}.
