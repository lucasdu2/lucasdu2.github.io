◊portrait["assets/myface.jpg" "a picture of my face"] I am an ◊strong{incoming computer science MS student at UC Davis}. I'm currently taking a brief break between working full-time and starting up school again.

Previously, I worked on cloud storage at eBay. As an undergraduate, I studied computer science at UChicago.

I'm interested in ◊strong{programming languages} and ◊strong{formal methods research} to ◊em{improve} the quality of software systems and ◊em{make it easier} to develop higher quality software. Software should be more empowering and less frustrating for both developers and users. 

◊headline{Research Interests}

My primary goal is to ◊em{put stronger and broader provable guarantees about real-world software systems within reach of more programmers}. I'm particularly interested in areas where traditional, ad-hoc testing techniques fall painfully short, i.e. distributed/concurrent/parallel systems or software security.

A secondary, related goal is to ◊em{drastically reduce the complexity of reliable, secure concurrent and distributed applications} (while preserving or even increasing performance).

I believe the best way forward is through mathematical abstraction and logical proof. To that end, I have interests in program logics, type theory, functional programming, and formal verification. I also have broader interests in distributed systems theory, compilers, security, cryptography, and high-performance parallel computing.

Currently, I'm looking at tools for verifying complex concurrent data structures using separation logic and automated solvers.
