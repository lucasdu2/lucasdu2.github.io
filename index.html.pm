◊portrait["assets/myface.jpg" "a picture of my face"] I am an incoming computer science MS student at ◊link["https://cs.ucdavis.edu/graduate/graduate-group"]{UC Davis}. Previously, I worked on cloud storage at ◊link["https://innovation.ebayinc.com/tech/engineering/"]{eBay}. As an undergraduate, I studied computer science at ◊link["https://cs.uchicago.edu/"]{UChicago}.

I'm interested in ◊strong{programming languages} and ◊strong{formal methods}, with an eye to increasing the ◊em{correctness, security, privacy, and simplicity} of realistic software systems. I also have a particular interest in concurrent and distributed systems. More broadly, I want to help move software ◊em{away from heuristics and hacks} and ◊em{onto more solid, elegant, and principled ground}.
