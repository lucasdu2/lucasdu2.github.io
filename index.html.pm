◊portrait["assets/myface.jpg" "a picture of my face"] I am an ◊strong{incoming computer science MS student at UC Davis}. I'm currently taking a brief break between working full-time and starting up school again.

Previously, I worked on cloud storage at eBay. As an undergraduate, I studied computer science at UChicago.

I'm interested in ◊strong{programming languages} and ◊strong{formal methods research} to ◊em{improve} the quality of software systems and ◊em{make it easier} to develop higher quality software. Software should be more empowering and less frustrating for both developers and users.

◊headline{Research Interests}

I have interests in program logics, type theory, functional programming, and formal verification. I also have broader interests in distributed systems theory, security, cryptography, and high-performance parallel computing.

Currently, I'm interested in the ◊strong{formal verification of concurrent and distributed systems}. I want strong formal guarantees, specifically about correctness and security, from performance-sensitive foundational systems (i.e. databases, filesystems, browsers) and web-based applications.

I'm also interested in ◊strong{better programming models for parallel and distributed computing}. We need better tools and abstractions to make building simple and efficient (and correct, secure, and private) parallel/concurrent/distributed software much easier.
